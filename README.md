This app is designed to teach simple Italian phrases to , currently, English speakers. 
There is a learning mode, and a testing mode. 
The learning mode is self-paced. You click on an answer when you are ready. 
The testing mode is timed (you get to choose the speed), and scored.

There are currently no dependencies for this app. 
The app is build using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JAVASCRIPT. There are plans to use BOOTSTRAP to improve styling. 
Currently, the app runs entirely on the client-side, but eventually, will be updated from a server.
